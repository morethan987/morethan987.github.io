OverLeaf is foreign software, and its related LaTeX projects are also hosted abroad. Therefore, directly accessing foreign traffic when downloading dependencies can save a lot of trouble. If you don‚Äôt have a VPN, you will need to specify a domestic source for each package manager, though sometimes the updates from domestic sources are not timely.\nBasic familiarity with Vim operations is useful, such as: how to enter insert mode, how to save and exit, how to exit without saving, etc.\nFull Deployment Process # Installing Linux # Search for a Linux distribution in the Windows App Store and download it. The author chose Kali. After installation, you can open it directly from the Start menu. Upon opening, a command-line window will pop up, and you will need to register with a username and password.\nAt this point, your command line should display a warning. This is because you haven‚Äôt installed WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).\nAlso, when entering the password, your input will not be displayed in the command line, but it has been recorded.\nWhy do you need a Linux system? Because OverLeaf\u0026rsquo;s ShareLaTeX model requires a Linux environment. It is said that OverLeaf runs more smoothly on Linux systems.\nInstalling WSL # To install WSL2, run the following in the Windows command line:\nwsl --install After installation, you can open it directly. Another warning will appear. At this point, you need to create a text file in the C:\\Users\\ASUS directory and rename it to .wslconfig.\nEnter the following content:\n[experimental] autoMemoryReclaim=gradual # gradual | dropcache | disabled networkingMode=mirrored dnsTunneling=true firewall=true autoProxy=true Installing Docker # Go to the Docker website to download Docker, which will be the container for the ShareLaTeX model. Docker is an open-source application container engine that includes images, containers, and repositories. Its purpose is to manage the lifecycle of application components, such as encapsulation, distribution, deployment, and operation, allowing users to \u0026ldquo;package once, run anywhere,\u0026rdquo; much like a container, developed and encapsulated by programmers, which users can directly move around.\nOnce Docker is installed, you can double-click to start it in the background. We will interact with Docker later via the command line.\nPulling the Image # Open Kali, and run the following command:\ngit clone https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit.git ./overleaf-toolkit Then run:\ncd ./overleaf-toolkit bin/init vim ./config/variables.env At this point, you should be in the document interface of the Vim text editor. Vim has many shortcuts, and pressing the \u0026quot;I\u0026quot; key will enter insert mode for text editing. Press \u0026quot;esc\u0026quot; to return to normal mode. In insert mode, type: OVERLEAF_SITE_LANGUAGE=zh-CN.\nAfter typing, press \u0026quot;esc\u0026quot; to return to normal mode, then type :wq to \u0026ldquo;save and quit.\u0026rdquo; If you make a mistake, type :e! to discard all changes and start over. This step will set your OverLeaf interface to Chinese.\nAfter successfully saving and quitting, return to the familiar Kali command-line interface and run bin/up. This will pull the ShareLaTeX image and related network tools. There will be a large amount of data transfer, so ensure that your network is stable (your VPN should be reliable!).\nConfiguring the User # Once the previous command finishes, run bin/start. At this point, open Docker and enter the ShareLaTeX container. You should see code \u0026ldquo;flashing.\u0026rdquo; If there are no red messages, everything is running normally.\nNow open a browser and visit http://localhost/launchpad.\nAfter registering an Administrator Account, you will be redirected to http://localhost/project. The basic OverLeaf webpage should now be displayed. If you compile now, it will most likely report an error ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó.\nThis is because ShareLaTeX is missing many required packagesüôÉ\u0026quot;\nInstalling Extension Packages # Open Kali, navigate to the appropriate directory, and run bin/shell. Then execute the following one by one:\ncd /usr/local/texlive # Download and run the upgrade script wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh sh update-tlmgr-latest.sh -- --upgrade # Change the TeX Live download source tlmgr option repository https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/ # Upgrade tlmgr tlmgr update --self --all # Install the full TeX Live package (this will take time, so don‚Äôt let the shell disconnect) tlmgr install scheme-full # Exit the ShareLaTeX command-line interface exit # Restart the ShareLaTeX container docker restart sharelatex After restarting, enter the shell again and run:\napt update # Install fonts apt install --no-install-recommends ttf-mscorefonts-installer fonts-noto texlive-fonts-recommended tex-gyre fonts-wqy-microhei fonts-wqy-zenhei fonts-noto-cjk fonts-noto-cjk-extra fonts-noto-color-emoji fonts-noto-extra fonts-noto-ui-core fonts-noto-ui-extra fonts-noto-unhinted fonts-texgyre # Install pygments apt install python3-pygments # Install Beamer and others apt install texlive-latex-recommended apt install texlive-latex-extra # Install English fonts echo \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; | apt install -y --reinstall ttf-mscorefonts-installer # Install Chinese fonts apt install -y latex-cjk-all texlive-lang-chinese texlive-lang-english cp fonts/* /usr/share/fonts/zh-cn/ cd /usr/share/fonts fc-cache -fv # Update font cache fc-list :lang=zh-cn fc-match Arial Finally, in the shell directory, run:\nvim /usr/local/texlive/2023/texmf.cnf Open the configuration file and add shell_escape = t at the bottom.\nI‚Äôm not sure what this does, but it was passed down by the predecessors ü§î Note, if the TeX Live version (the official name for extension packages) differs, the directory path may also change. You will need to adjust the path based on the actual version, for example, change 2023 to 2024.\nYou can use ls -l in the Linux command line to view all files in the current directory. Successful Deployment # Now you can happily use your local OverLeaf version without worrying about compilation timeouts~\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re lucky and happen to be a CQUer, here‚Äôs a graduation thesis template from Chongqing University, super user-friendly: CQUThesis\n","date":"12 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/localoverleaf/","section":"Blogs","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eBackground Overview \n    \u003cdiv id=\"background-overview\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#background-overview\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should know how to interact with the computer via the command line, including but not limited to: how to open the command line/terminal in Windows, when a running command ends, etc.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Local OverLeaf Deployment","type":"blog"},{"content":" Reference # Honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with BayesianOPT, the opinions mentioned stem from the below. üëá\n„ÄêÊú∫Âô®Â≠¶‰π†„Äë‰∏ÄÊñáÁúãÊáÇË¥ùÂè∂ÊñØ‰ºòÂåñ/Bayesian Optimization\n‰∏ÄÊñáËØ¶Ëß£Ë¥ùÂè∂ÊñØ‰ºòÂåñÔºàBayesian OptimizationÔºâÂéüÁêÜ\nË¥ùÂè∂ÊñØ‰ºòÂåñ(BayesianOptimization)\nË∂ÖÂèÇÊï∞‰ºò\u0026mdash;Ë¥ùÂè∂ÊñØ‰ºòÂåñÂèäÂÖ∂ÊîπËøõÔºàPBT‰ºòÂåñÔºâ\nË¥ùÂè∂ÊñØ‰ºòÂåñ (Bayesian Optimization)\nMATLAB Offical Document\nAdvantages \u0026amp; Algorithm Principle # Here we are going to talk about the advantages \u0026amp; algorithm principle of BayesianOPT.
